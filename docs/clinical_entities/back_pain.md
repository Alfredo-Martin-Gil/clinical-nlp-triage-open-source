# Clinical Entity
## Name
Back pain

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with back pain who may have serious underlying pathology requiring urgent evaluation (e.g., spinal cord compression, infection, fracture, vascular emergency) and distinguish them from benign mechanical causes.

## Typical Presentations
- Acute or subacute lumbar or thoracic pain  
- Pain after exertion or minor trauma  
- Chronic back pain with acute worsening  
- Back pain associated with radicular symptoms  
- Back pain with systemic symptoms (fever, malaise)

## Key Questions
- Onset (sudden vs gradual) and duration  
- History of trauma (even low energy)  
- Radiation to legs or buttocks  
- Presence of weakness, numbness, or paresthesia  
- Bladder or bowel dysfunction  
- Fever or recent infection  
- History of cancer, osteoporosis, or immunosuppression  
- Use of anticoagulants or IV drugs

## Red Flags
- New urinary retention or fecal incontinence  
- Saddle anesthesia  
- Progressive or severe motor weakness  
- Fever with spinal pain  
- History of malignancy with new back pain  
- Significant trauma or minor trauma in elderly  
- Pain that is constant, severe, or worsening at rest  
- Pulsatile abdominal pain or known aneurysm

## Risk Factors
- Age > 65 years  
- Known cancer  
- Immunosuppression  
- IV drug use  
- Osteoporosis  
- Recent spinal procedures  
- Anticoagulant therapy

## Exclusion / Caution
- Chronic stable mechanical back pain without red flags  
- Known degenerative disease with typical recurrent pattern

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Emergency department evaluation (possible imaging and urgent specialist assessment)  
- Intermediate → Urgent outpatient assessment or ED depending on availability and evolution  
- Low risk → Symptomatic treatment and primary care follow-up

## Notes
Most acute back pain is mechanical, but presence of red flags should shift focus toward excluding spinal cord compression, infection, fracture, or vascular causes.
