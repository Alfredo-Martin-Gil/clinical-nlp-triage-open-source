# Clinical Entity
## Name
Altered mental status / Confusion

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with altered mental status who may have life-threatening etiologies (e.g., hypoglycemia, stroke, sepsis, hypoxia, intoxication) requiring immediate intervention.

## Typical Presentations
- Acute confusion or disorientation  
- Decreased level of consciousness  
- Agitation or lethargy  
- New onset delirium  
- Unresponsive or minimally responsive patient

## Key Questions
- Time of onset and progression  
- Baseline mental status  
- Recent trauma or falls  
- Fever or recent infection  
- Medication or substance exposure  
- History of diabetes, seizures, stroke, dementia  
- Associated focal neurological symptoms

## Red Flags
- GCS < 13 or rapidly declining mental status  
- Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia  
- Hypoxia or respiratory distress  
- New focal neurological deficit  
- Fever with altered mental status  
- Signs of head trauma  
- Seizure or postictal state  
- Suspected intoxication or overdose

## Risk Factors
- Advanced age  
- Polypharmacy  
- Diabetes mellitus  
- Chronic kidney or liver disease  
- Alcohol or substance use disorder  
- Known neurological disease

## Exclusion / Caution
- Chronic stable cognitive impairment without acute change  
- Known dementia at baseline with no new features

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Emergency department evaluation  
- Intermediate → Urgent medical assessment  
- Low risk → Outpatient evaluation if clear reversible cause and stable

## Notes
Altered mental status is a symptom, not a diagnosis. Always prioritize assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, oxygenation, and glucose.
