# Clinical Entity

## Name
Dyspnea (Shortness of Breath)

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with shortness of breath who may have a life-threatening respiratory or cardiac condition requiring high-priority triage.

## Typical Presentations
- Acute onset shortness of breath  
- Worsening chronic dyspnea  
- Labored breathing  
- Inability to speak full sentences  
- Associated cough or chest discomfort  

## Key Questions
- When did the breathing difficulty start?  
- Is it sudden or gradual?  
- Any chest pain or fever?  
- History of lung or heart disease?  
- Any recent infection or immobilization?  

## Red Flags
- Severe respiratory distress  
- Oxygen saturation low or unknown with distress  
- Cyanosis  
- Altered mental status  
- Chest pain with dyspnea  

## Risk Factors
- Chronic lung disease  
- Heart failure  
- Recent infection  
- Smoking  
- Older age  

## Exclusion / Caution
- Anxiety-related dyspnea may mimic severe disease  
- Mild upper respiratory infection may present with dyspnea sensation  

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → urgent transport and priority evaluation  
- Intermediate → medical evaluation recommended  
- Low risk → consider non-urgent assessment if stable
