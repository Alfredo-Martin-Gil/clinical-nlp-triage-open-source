# Syncope (TLoC) — Condition-specific guideline alignment (non-clinical use)

## Purpose
This document provides condition-specific reference notes to inform **risk-based triage reasoning** in this research prototype.
It is not a diagnostic or treatment guideline, and it is not intended for real patient care.

## High-risk features commonly emphasized in international guidance (conceptual)
- Older age / frailty context
- Absence or unclear prodrome
- Potential cardiac features (e.g., exertional syncope, palpitations, family history of sudden death)
- Abnormal vital signs or signs of poor perfusion
- Persistent altered mental status
- Associated chest pain, severe dyspnea, or focal neurological deficits
- High-risk comorbidity context (cardiac disease, significant structural heart disease)

## Triage implication (research framing)
In prehospital/ED triage, the presence of high-risk features generally supports **elevated priority** for prompt transport and in-hospital evaluation, even if the patient is transiently stable.

## International references (to be expanded with exact citations)
- ESC syncope guideline (risk stratification and high-risk features)
- ACEP clinical policy on syncope evaluation
- NICE guidance on transient loss of consciousness (TLoC)
- Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS) (conceptual alignment)
