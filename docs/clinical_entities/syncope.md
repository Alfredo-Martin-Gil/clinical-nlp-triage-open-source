# Clinical Entity

## Name
Syncope (Transient Loss of Consciousness, TLoC)

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with transient loss of consciousness who may have a high risk of serious underlying cause and require elevated triage priority.

## Typical Presentations
- Brief loss of consciousness with spontaneous recovery
- Collapse with or without prodrome
- Witnessed or unwitnessed episode
- Post-event confusion or fatigue

## Key Questions
- Was there a prodrome (dizziness, nausea, visual changes)?
- Did it occur during exertion or while supine?
- Any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath?
- History of heart disease or sudden cardiac death in family?
- Was there trauma associated with the event?

## Red Flags
- Absence or unclear prodrome  
- Exertional syncope  
- Palpitations before event  
- Abnormal vital signs or signs of poor perfusion  
- Persistent altered mental status  
- Associated chest pain, severe dyspnea, or focal neurological deficits  

## Risk Factors
- Older age / frailty  
- Known cardiac disease  
- Significant structural heart disease  
- High-risk comorbidity context  

## Exclusion / Caution
- Simple vasovagal episodes with clear prodrome and full recovery may be lower risk  
- Intoxication, metabolic disturbance, or seizure may mimic syncope  

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → urgent transport and priority evaluation  
- Intermediate → medical evaluation recommended  
- Low risk → consider non-urgent assessment if stable  

## Notes
Conceptual alignment with international guidance (ESC syncope guideline, ACEP clinical policy, NICE TLoC, Canadian Syncope Risk Score).
