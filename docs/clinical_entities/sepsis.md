# Clinical Entity

## Name
Sepsis / Suspected Severe Infection

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with suspected infection who may have sepsis or impending shock and require high-priority triage.

## Typical Presentations
- Fever or hypothermia  
- Chills or rigors  
- Altered mental status  
- Generalized weakness  
- Suspected source of infection  

## Key Questions
- Is there fever or recent infection?  
- Any confusion or change in mental status?  
- Any breathing difficulty?  
- Any urinary, respiratory, abdominal, or skin symptoms?  
- History of immunosuppression or chronic disease?  

## Red Flags
- Altered mental status  
- Hypotension or signs of poor perfusion  
- Tachypnea  
- High or very low temperature  
- Mottled or cool skin  

## Risk Factors
- Older age  
- Immunosuppression  
- Diabetes mellitus  
- Chronic kidney disease  
- Cancer  

## Exclusion / Caution
- Localized mild infection without systemic features may be lower risk  
- Fever alone does not equal sepsis  

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → urgent transport and priority evaluation  
- Intermediate → medical evaluation recommended  
- Low risk → consider non-urgent assessment if stable  

## Notes
Early recognition of systemic involvement is the main triage objective. Research reference only.
