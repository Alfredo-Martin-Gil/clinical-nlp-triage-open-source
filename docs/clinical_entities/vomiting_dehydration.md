## Name
Vomiting and Dehydration

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with vomiting who may have significant dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, or underlying serious conditions requiring urgent evaluation, while distinguishing low-risk self-limited illness.

## Typical Presentations
- Recurrent vomiting
- Inability to tolerate oral intake
- Associated diarrhea
- Vomiting with abdominal pain
- Vomiting with fever
- Signs of dehydration

## Key Questions
- Onset and duration?
- Frequency of vomiting?
- Able to keep fluids down?
- Presence of blood or coffee-ground material?
- Associated abdominal pain?
- Fever?
- Diarrhea?
- Urine output?
- Chronic diseases (diabetes, kidney disease)?

## Red Flags
- Persistent vomiting
- Signs of severe dehydration
- Altered mental status
- Severe abdominal pain
- Hematemesis
- Hypotension
- Oliguria or anuria

## Risk Factors
- Advanced age
- Infants or young children
- Diabetes mellitus
- Chronic kidney disease
- Diuretic use
- Recent travel or food exposure

## Exclusion / Caution
- Mild nausea without vomiting
- Single self-limited vomiting episode
- Known benign cause with rapid improvement

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Immediate emergency evaluation
- Intermediate → Urgent same-day assessment
- Low risk → Outpatient management

## Notes
Focuses on assessing hydration status and systemic risk rather than specific gastrointestinal diagnosis.
