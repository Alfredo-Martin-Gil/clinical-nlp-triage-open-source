# Clinical Entity
## Name
Minor / Moderate Trauma

## Clinical Goal
Identify trauma patients who may have occult serious injury despite apparently minor mechanism and distinguish them from low-risk injuries.

## Typical Presentations
- Low-energy falls  
- Minor head injury  
- Limb trauma  
- Soft tissue injury  
- Pain after blunt trauma

## Key Questions
- Mechanism of injury  
- Height of fall or force involved  
- Loss of consciousness or amnesia  
- Anticoagulant or antiplatelet use  
- Pain location and severity  
- Neurological symptoms

## Red Flags
- Loss of consciousness  
- Persistent vomiting  
- Severe headache  
- New focal neurological deficit  
- Signs of skull fracture  
- Hypotension or tachycardia  
- Severe pain or deformity

## Risk Factors
- Age > 65 years  
- Anticoagulant therapy  
- Osteoporosis  
- High-risk mechanism

## Exclusion / Caution
- Superficial isolated soft tissue injury with no red flags

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Emergency department evaluation  
- Intermediate → Medical assessment  
- Low risk → Outpatient management

## Notes
Elderly patients and anticoagulated patients warrant lower threshold for imaging and ED evaluation.
