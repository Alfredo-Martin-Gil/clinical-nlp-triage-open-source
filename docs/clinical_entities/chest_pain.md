# Clinical Entity

## Name
Chest Pain

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with chest pain who may have a life-threatening cardiovascular, respiratory, or vascular cause and require high-priority triage.

## Typical Presentations
- Central or left-sided chest pain
- Pressure, tightness, heaviness, burning
- Pain radiating to arm, neck, jaw, or back
- Sudden onset chest discomfort
- Chest pain associated with dyspnea or diaphoresis

## Key Questions
- When did the pain start?
- Is the pain constant or intermittent?
- Does it radiate anywhere?
- Is it associated with shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating?
- Any history of heart disease or similar episodes?

## Red Flags
- Ongoing chest pain at rest  
- Radiation to arm, jaw, or back  
- Associated dyspnea  
- Syncope or near syncope  
- Diaphoresis  
- Hemodynamic instability  

## Risk Factors
- Older age  
- Known coronary artery disease  
- Hypertension  
- Diabetes mellitus  
- Smoking  
- Hyperlipidemia  

## Exclusion / Caution
- Musculoskeletal chest pain may mimic serious causes  
- Gastroesophageal pain may mimic cardiac pain  

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → urgent transport and priority evaluation  
- Intermediate → medical evaluation recommended  
- Low risk → consider non-urgent assessment if stable  

## Notes
Focus is triage risk, not diagnosis. This is a research-oriented reference only.
