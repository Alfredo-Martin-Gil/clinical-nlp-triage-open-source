# Clinical Entity
## Name
Allergic reaction / Anaphylaxis

## Clinical Goal
Rapidly identify patients with anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions requiring immediate treatment and distinguish them from mild allergic presentations.

## Typical Presentations
- Urticaria or pruritus  
- Angioedema (lips, tongue, face)  
- Dyspnea or wheezing  
- Throat tightness or voice change  
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain  
- Dizziness or syncope

## Key Questions
- Exposure to food, drug, insect sting, or latex  
- Time from exposure to symptom onset  
- Previous allergic reactions or anaphylaxis  
- Respiratory symptoms  
- Cardiovascular symptoms  
- Response to prior treatment (antihistamines, epinephrine)

## Red Flags
- Airway compromise  
- Respiratory distress or wheezing  
- Hypotension or shock  
- Rapid progression of symptoms  
- Stridor or voice change  
- Altered mental status

## Risk Factors
- History of anaphylaxis  
- Asthma  
- Known severe allergies  
- Mast cell disorders

## Exclusion / Caution
- Localized mild rash without systemic symptoms

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Emergency department evaluation and immediate epinephrine  
- Intermediate → Medical observation  
- Low risk → Outpatient management with instructions

## Notes
Epinephrine is first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and should not be delayed.
