# Clinical Entity

## Name
Stroke / Acute Neurological Deficit

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with acute neurological symptoms who may have stroke or other time-sensitive central nervous system pathology requiring high-priority triage.

## Typical Presentations
- Sudden weakness or numbness of face, arm, or leg  
- Difficulty speaking or understanding speech  
- Facial droop  
- Sudden vision changes  
- Sudden severe headache  

## Key Questions
- When was the patient last seen normal?  
- What symptoms started suddenly?  
- Any speech or vision problems?  
- Any weakness or asymmetry?  
- History of stroke or atrial fibrillation?  

## Red Flags
- Sudden focal neurological deficit  
- Altered mental status  
- Severe headache with neurological signs  
- Seizure at onset  

## Risk Factors
- Older age  
- Hypertension  
- Diabetes mellitus  
- Atrial fibrillation  
- Prior stroke or TIA  

## Exclusion / Caution
- Hypoglycemia may mimic stroke  
- Postictal states may mimic stroke  

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → urgent transport and priority evaluation  
- Intermediate → medical evaluation recommended  
- Low risk → consider non-urgent assessment if stable  

## Notes
Time-dependent condition. Early recognition is critical. Research triage reference only.
