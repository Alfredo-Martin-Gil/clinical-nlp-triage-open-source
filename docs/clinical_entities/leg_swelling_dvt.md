# Clinical Entity
## Name
Leg swelling / DVT risk

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with leg swelling who may have deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism risk and require urgent evaluation.

## Typical Presentations
- Unilateral leg swelling  
- Leg pain or tenderness  
- Warmth or erythema of limb  
- Bilateral leg swelling with dyspnea  
- Recent immobilization with leg symptoms

## Key Questions
- Unilateral or bilateral swelling  
- Onset and progression  
- Pain or tenderness  
- Recent surgery, trauma, or immobilization  
- History of DVT or PE  
- Active cancer  
- Dyspnea or chest pain

## Red Flags
- Unilateral painful swollen leg  
- Dyspnea or hypoxia  
- Chest pain suggestive of PE  
- Syncope  
- Tachycardia or hypotension

## Risk Factors
- Recent surgery  
- Prolonged immobilization  
- Active malignancy  
- Pregnancy or postpartum  
- Estrogen therapy  
- Prior DVT/PE

## Exclusion / Caution
- Chronic bilateral edema with known heart failure  
- Known chronic venous insufficiency without change

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Emergency department evaluation  
- Intermediate → Urgent medical assessment  
- Low risk → Outpatient evaluation

## Notes
Consider pulmonary embolism in any patient with leg swelling plus respiratory or cardiac symptoms.
