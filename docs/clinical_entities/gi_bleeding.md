# Clinical Entity
## Name
Gastrointestinal Bleeding

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with gastrointestinal bleeding who may have hemodynamic instability or significant blood loss requiring urgent evaluation, while distinguishing lower-risk presentations.

## Typical Presentations
- Hematemesis
- Coffee-ground vomiting
- Melena
- Hematochezia
- Dizziness or syncope
- Fatigue or weakness

## Key Questions
- Type of bleeding (vomiting blood vs black stools vs red blood)?
- Onset and duration?
- Quantity of blood?
- Associated abdominal pain?
- Dizziness or syncope?
- History of liver disease?
- NSAID or anticoagulant use?
- Prior GI bleeding?

## Red Flags
- Hemodynamic instability
- Syncope
- Ongoing active bleeding
- Severe anemia symptoms
- Altered mental status

## Risk Factors
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Cirrhosis or portal hypertension
- Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy
- NSAID use
- Prior GI bleed
- Advanced age

## Exclusion / Caution
- Minimal blood on wiping with known hemorrhoids
- Dark stools clearly related to iron or bismuth

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Immediate emergency evaluation
- Intermediate → Urgent same-day assessment
- Low risk → Outpatient gastroenterology evaluation

## Notes
This entity focuses on identifying unsafe bleeding patterns rather than determining bleeding source.
