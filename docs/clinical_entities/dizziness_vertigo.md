# Clinical Entity
## Name
Dizziness / Vertigo

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with dizziness or vertigo who may have life-threatening or central causes (e.g., stroke, arrhythmia, hemorrhage) and distinguish them from benign peripheral vestibular conditions.

## Typical Presentations
- Sensation of spinning (true vertigo)  
- Lightheadedness or presyncope  
- Imbalance or unsteadiness  
- Dizziness associated with head movement  
- Acute continuous dizziness

## Key Questions
- Onset (sudden vs gradual)  
- Continuous vs episodic symptoms  
- Triggers (head movement, position change)  
- Associated focal neurological symptoms  
- Chest pain or palpitations  
- Recent infection  
- New headache or neck pain  
- Medication or toxin exposure

## Red Flags
- New focal neurological deficit  
- Inability to walk or stand  
- Severe sudden-onset headache  
- Persistent vomiting  
- New hearing loss with neurological signs  
- Chest pain or syncope  
- Abnormal vital signs

## Risk Factors
- Age > 60 years  
- Hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia  
- Atrial fibrillation or known cardiac disease  
- Prior stroke or TIA  
- Smoking

## Exclusion / Caution
- Typical benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with classic features and no red flags  
- Chronic stable vestibular symptoms previously evaluated

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Emergency department evaluation (rule out central cause)  
- Intermediate → Urgent medical assessment  
- Low risk → Symptomatic treatment and outpatient follow-up

## Notes
Central causes must be considered in acute continuous dizziness, especially in older patients or those with vascular risk factors.
