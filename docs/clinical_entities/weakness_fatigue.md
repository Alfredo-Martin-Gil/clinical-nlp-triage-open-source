# Clinical Entity
## Name
Weakness / Fatigue

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with weakness or fatigue who may have serious underlying causes (e.g., stroke, sepsis, electrolyte disorders, cardiac disease, anemia) requiring urgent evaluation.

## Typical Presentations
- Generalized weakness  
- Focal weakness  
- Fatigue with reduced functional capacity  
- Sudden inability to perform usual activities  
- Progressive weakness

## Key Questions
- Onset and progression  
- Focal vs generalized symptoms  
- Associated neurological symptoms  
- Fever or signs of infection  
- Chest pain or dyspnea  
- Recent bleeding  
- Medication changes  
- Past history of stroke, anemia, cardiac disease

## Red Flags
- New focal neurological deficit  
- Sudden onset weakness  
- Inability to walk or stand  
- Severe dyspnea or chest pain  
- Signs of sepsis  
- Evidence of active bleeding  
- Abnormal vital signs

## Risk Factors
- Advanced age  
- Cardiovascular disease  
- Diabetes mellitus  
- Chronic kidney disease  
- Malignancy  
- Polypharmacy

## Exclusion / Caution
- Chronic stable fatigue with known cause  
- Long-standing weakness without change

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Emergency department evaluation  
- Intermediate → Urgent medical assessment  
- Low risk → Outpatient follow-up

## Notes
Always differentiate true muscle weakness from fatigue or deconditioning. Consider stroke in any acute focal deficit.
