# Clinical Entity
## Name
Palpitations

## Clinical Goal
Identify patients with palpitations who may have clinically significant arrhythmias or unstable cardiac conditions requiring urgent evaluation, while distinguishing benign or low-risk presentations.

## Typical Presentations
- Sensation of rapid heartbeat
- Irregular heartbeat
- Skipped beats
- Sudden onset palpitations
- Palpitations with dizziness
- Palpitations with chest discomfort
- Palpitations during exertion

## Key Questions
- Onset (sudden vs gradual)?
- Duration of episodes?
- Regular or irregular rhythm sensation?
- Associated dizziness or syncope?
- Chest pain present?
- Shortness of breath?
- Previous similar episodes?
- Known heart disease?
- Stimulant use (caffeine, drugs, medications)?

## Red Flags
- Syncope or near-syncope
- Chest pain suggestive of ischemia
- Severe shortness of breath
- Hypotension
- Sustained tachycardia
- Known structural heart disease

## Risk Factors
- History of arrhythmia
- Structural heart disease
- Ischemic heart disease
- Electrolyte abnormalities
- Thyroid disease
- Stimulant or drug use

## Exclusion / Caution
- Brief, infrequent palpitations without symptoms
- Palpitations clearly associated with anxiety and no red flags
- Isolated premature beats in known low-risk patients

## Suggested Disposition
- High risk → Immediate emergency evaluation
- Intermediate → Urgent same-day assessment
- Low risk → Outpatient evaluation

## Notes
This entity focuses on risk stratification based on symptoms and context, not rhythm diagnosis.
