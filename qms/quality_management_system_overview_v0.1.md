# Quality Management System (QMS) – Overview v0.1

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the foundational Quality Management System (QMS) structure for this project.

The system is designed to be:

- Compatible with ISO 13485 principles
- Aligned with IMDRF SaMD guidance
- Adaptable to ANMAT (Argentina) and Health Canada requirements

This version represents a pre-certification structural framework.

---

## 2. Scope

The QMS applies to:

- Software development
- Risk management
- Documentation control
- Change management
- Regulatory positioning
- Safety architecture

It covers all repository artifacts and development activities.

---

## 3. Quality Policy

The organization commits to:

- Safety-first design.
- Explicit uncertainty handling.
- Traceable decision logic.
- Conservative risk posture.
- Transparent limitation disclosure.
- Continuous improvement.

No feature shall be implemented without documented alignment with:
- Context of use
- Hazard model
- Failure behavior contract
- Uncertainty model

---

## 4. QMS Structure

The QMS is composed of the following controlled documents:

- Quality Management System Overview
- Document Control Procedure
- Change Control Procedure
- Risk Management Procedure
- Software Lifecycle Procedure
- Regulatory Positioning Documentation
- Clinical Safety Documentation

Each document must include:
- Version identifier
- Change history
- Approval record (future phase)

---

## 5. Document Control Principles

All controlled documents must:

- Have a clear version number.
- Be stored in version control (Git).
- Maintain traceable change history.
- Be linked to related artifacts where applicable.

No undocumented change to:
- Risk logic
- Escalation policy
- Uncertainty thresholds
- Regulatory claims

is permitted.

---

## 6. Risk Management Alignment

Risk management activities shall align with:

- ISO 14971 principles (structure-compatible)
- Hazard identification
- Risk analysis
- Risk mitigation
- Residual risk evaluation

Risk documentation must link directly to implementation artifacts.

---

## 7. Software Lifecycle Alignment

Development lifecycle must include:

- Requirement definition
- Risk assessment
- Design specification
- Implementation
- Verification (tests)
- Documentation update

No code change shall be merged without documentation alignment.

---

## 8. Regulatory Evolution Strategy

Phase 1:
- Structured CDS assistive system
- No autonomous authority

Phase 2:
- Expanded functionality under documented risk review

Phase 3:
- Formal regulatory submission preparation

---

## 9. Development Constraint

This QMS framework becomes active immediately.

All future repository modifications must align with this structure.

Deviation requires documented justification.
